incorporate_bohemia_title;Incorporate The Kingdom of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_bohemia_desc;We should incorporate the Czech kingdoms into our empire.

Although, it would come at a cost, as our administration would have to work with an additional official language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_croatia_title;The Kingdom of Croatia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_croatia_desc;The people of The Kingdom of Croatia have proven in 1848, that we can rely on them as friends. We should be thankful for their servitude during the Hungarian Revolution. We should welcome the croats to the group of equal citizens of our empire. Although, it would come at a cost, as our administration would have to work with an additional official language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

incorporate_transylvania_title;Siebenburgen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_transylvania_desc;Transylvania was administered separately from Hungary by Austria before the Hungarian revolution. The region is inhabited by Germans, Hungarians, and Romanians, the latter of which showed their support for the Habsburg during the Hungarian Revolution. We should thank these people by recognizing them as equal citizens of the empire. Although, it would come at a cost, as our administration would have to work with an additional official language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_venice_title;Metternich's Words;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_venice_desc;Certain parts of Italy have been under Habsburg rule for a long time, and it still seems like the Italians have failed to unite their culture under one country. Nevertheless, we should show our Italian citizens that they do not need such delusions as nationalism to be as free as their forefathers were. We should recognise our Italian-speaking citizens as equals, so that they can realise this. Although, it would come at a cost, as our administration would have to work with an additional official language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

deal_with_hungarian_nobles_title;Deal with the Hungarian Nobles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deal_with_hungarian_nobles_desc;The Nobles of Hungary still want to lay their claims on the former lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. This prevents us from coming to good ends with the Hungarian populations of our empire. If the Hungarian nobles are too stubborn to give their childish dreams up, we will have to make them not have dreams anymore. It is time to persecute them, and hunt them all down, that would stop them from blinding the Hungarian public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

incorporate_slovenia_kuk_desc;In the year 1882, Slovene became a majority language in the Diet of Carniola, which replaced German with Slovene as the primary official language of the local government.

incorporate_galicia_kuk_title;Polish Language Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_galicia_kuk_desc;In the year 1869, Polish became the official language of administration in Galicia.

incorporate_venice_kuk_title;Italian Language Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
incorporate_venice_kuk_desc;Italian has always been recognised as a cultural language (Kulturspache) by the german public. We should perhaps institute those rights.

hungarian_silk_desc;Silk production in Hungary started as early as the mid 1800's, although it remained merely as a side income for the country for a while. By the late 1800s, silk production saw a considerable increase, and by 1905, Hungary was the 3rd largest producer of silk in Europe, behind France and Italy. This big leap in silk production was possible thanks to the innovation of people like Pal Bezeredj, who according to the advice of Louis Kossuth, started a major silk business in Tolna county in 1880.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
